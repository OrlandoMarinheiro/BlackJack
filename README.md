# BlackJack 

This project was developed as part of the Introduction to Computer Engineering course, aiming to create a website to apply knowledge of <span style="color: orange;">HTML</span>, <span style="color: lightblue;">CSS</span>, and <span style="color: yellow;">JavaScript</span>. The site allows playing Blackjack, viewing its history, and understanding its rules.
